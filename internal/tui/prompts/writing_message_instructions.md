# Understanding the "Writing Message" Stage

This stage is the heart of generating your commit message with AI help in CommitCraft. In this view, your screen is divided into two main areas:

1. **Your Input (Left Panel):** This is where you'll type your initial, short commit message or a brief summary of the changes you've made. This text will guide the AI in crafting the full commit message.
2. **AI's Suggestion (Right Panel):** This area will display the commit message generated by the AI, based on your input and the detected code changes.
